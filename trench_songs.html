<h2>LYRICS</h2>
<p>
<mark>[Intro]</mark><br>
Cover me, oh!<br>
<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
I can't believe how much I hate<br>
Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
I crumble underneath the weight<br>
Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
<br><mark>[Verse]</mark><br>
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?<br>
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
Dusting off my jumpsuit (Cover me)<br>
<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
I can't believe how much I hate (Cover me, oh)<br>
Pressures of a new place roll my way (Cover me, oh)<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)<br>
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)<br>
<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
I'll be right there<br>
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air<br>
If you need anyone<br>
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)<br>
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands<br>
If you need anyone<br>
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)<br>
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air<br>
(If you need anyone)<br>
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)<br>
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)<br>
If you need anyone<br>

	<h1>LEVITATE</h1>
	<h2>LYRICS</h2>
<p>
<mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet<br>
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe<br>
And though I feed on things that fell<br>
You can learn to levitate with just a little help<br>
Learn to levitate with just a little help<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
Come down, come down<br>
Cowards only come through when the hour's late<br>
And everyone's asleep, mind you<br>
Now show up, show up<br>
I know I shouldn't say this<br>
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man<br>
Come down, come down<br>
Cowards only come through when the hour's late<br>
And everyone's asleep, mind you<br>
Now show up, show up<br>
I know I shouldn't say this<br>
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man<br>

<br><mark>[Verse]</mark><br>
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made<br>
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late<br>
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made<br>
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say<br>
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above<br>
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought<br>
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train<br>
I got back what I once bought back<br>
In that slot, I won't need to replace<br>
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today<br>
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain<br>
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through<br>
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all<br>
I thought I could depend on my weekends<br>
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on<br>
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges<br>
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways<br>
Keep your wooden wedges under doors<br>
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight<br>
Wait, habits here too, youâ€™re the worst, your structure compensates<br>
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two<br>
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet<br>
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe<br>
And though I feed on things that fell<br>
You can learn to levitate with just a little help<br>
You can levitate with just a little help<br>

	<h1>MORPH</h1>
	<h2>LYRICS</h2>
<p>
<mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die for it<br>
Now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries<br>
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow<br>
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow<br>
We're surrounded and we're hounded<br>
There's no above, or under, or around it<br>
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve<br>
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see<br>
For if and when we go above, the question still remains<br>
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?<br>
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder<br>
But until that time, I'll try to sing this<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
What they throw at me's too slow<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
I'm just a ghost<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
A defense mechanism mode<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki<br>
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know<br>
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy<br>
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me<br>
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded<br>
There's no above or a secret door<br>
What are we here for<br>
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?<br>
But until that time, I'll try to sing this<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
What they throw at me's too slow<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
I'm just a ghost<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
A defense mechanism mode<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me<br>
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony<br>
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes<br>
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes<br>
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded<br>
There's no above, or under, or around it<br>
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve<br>
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see<br>
For if and when we go above, the question still remains<br>
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?<br>
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder<br>
But until that time<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
I'm just a ghost<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
What they throw at me's too slow<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
I'm just a ghost<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
A defense mechanism mode<br>
If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>
A defense mechanism mode<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>

<br><mark>[Outro]</mark><br>
Not done, not done<br>
Not done, Josh Dun<br>
I'll morph to someone else<br>

<mark>[Intro]</mark><br>
So, where are you? It's been a little while<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
Lovin' what I'm tastin', ooh<br>
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times<br>
Poisonous vibrations, ooh<br>
Help my body run<br>

I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>

Fall out of formation, ooh<br>

Rebel red carnation, ooh<br>

Runnin' for my life<br>
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 3]</mark><br>
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
But now you double as a paper maker<br>
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight<br>
And you in my life is like<br>

Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>

The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

I'm so sorry I forgot you<br>
Let me catch you up to speed<br>
I've been tested like the end of<br>
A weathered flag that's by the sea<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>

Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical<br>

You know<br>
I've always been collected, calm and chill<br>

But if Iâ€™m feeling<br>
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe<br>

Step to a dude much bigger than me<br>

I would get beat to smithereens<br>

<mark>[Intro]</mark><br>
Call, call, call<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
What's my problem?<br>
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom<br>
Underneath the insane asylum<br>
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em<br>
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'<br>
And my problem?<br>
We glorify those even more when they...<br>
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win<br>
And right before we turn on them<br>
We give 'em the highest of praise<br>
And hang their banner from the ceiling<br>
Communicating, further engraving<br>
An earlier grave is an optional way<br>
No<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
Neon gravestones try to call<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Call (For my bones)<br>
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)<br>
Call (Call)<br>
Call (Call)<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
What's my problem?<br>
Don't get it twisted<br>
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted<br>
I could use the streams and extra conversations<br>
I could give up, and boost up my reputation<br>
I could go out with a bang<br>
They would know my name<br>
They would host and post a celebration<br>
My opinion will not be lenient<br>
My opinion, it's real convenient<br>
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action<br>
We don't get enough love?<br>
Well, they get a fraction<br>
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?"<br>
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
Neon gravestones try to call<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Call (For my bones)<br>
Call, call, call<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge 1]</mark><br>
Promise me this (Call, call)<br>
If I lose to myself<br>
You won't mourn a day<br>
And you'll move onto someone else<br>
Promise me this<br>
If I lose to myself<br>
You won't mourn a day<br>
And you'll move onto someone else<br>
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)<br>

Neon gravestones try to call<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
Neon gravestones try to call<br>

Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge 2]</mark><br>
But they won't get them<br>
No, they won't get them<br>
They won't get them<br>
But they won't get them<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 3]</mark><br>
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness<br>
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us<br>
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness<br>
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?<br>
And could it be true that some could be tempted<br>
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?<br>
A form of succession?<br>
A form of a weapon?<br>
Thinking "I'll teach them"<br>
Well, I'm refusing the lesson<br>
It won't resonate in our minds<br>
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind<br>
Just pleading that it does not get glorified<br>
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high<br>
Find your grandparents or someone of age<br>
Pay some respects for the path that they paved<br>
To life, they were dedicated<br>
Now, that should be celebrated<br>

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low<br>
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br>
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that<br>
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control<br>
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady<br>
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh<br>
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high<br>
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady<br>
Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh<br>
I'm so high, I'm so high<br>
So high, I'm so high<br>
Fire, Nico and the Niners<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
What I say when I want to be enough<br>
What a beautiful day for making a break for it<br>
We'll find a way to pay for it<br>
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores<br>
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor<br>
And start a concert, a complete diversion<br>
Start a mob and you can be quite certain<br>
We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>
No, no<br>
We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>
No, no<br>
We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low<br>
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br>
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that<br>
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control<br>
East is up<br>

<br><mark>[Outro]</mark><br>
I'm so high, so high<br>
Fire, Nico and the Niners<br>
I'm so high, so high<br>
Sotidnab era ew<br>
Fire, Nico and the Niners<br>

	<h1>BANDITO</h1>
	<h2>LYRICS</h2>
	<p>
		<mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
This is the sound we make<br>
When in between two places<br>
Where we used to bleed<br>
And where our blood needs to be<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
In City, I feel my spirit is contained<br>
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain<br>
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire<br>
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire<br>
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof<br>
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth<br>
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you<br>
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>
I created this world to feel some control<br>
Destroy it if I want<br>
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo<br>

[Chorus]<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito (Sahlo)<br>
I could take the high road<br>
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)<br>
I'm a banâ€”I'm a bandito<br>

[Outro]<br>
I created this world to feel some control<br>
Destroy it if I want<br>
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>

	<h1>PET CHEETAH</h1>
	<h2>LYRICS</h2>
	<p>
		<mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
I am on an island, no one to confide<br>
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line<br>
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind<br>
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement<br>
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason<br>
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats<br>
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet<br>
I'ma get mine and get going<br>
I'm showing my faces in just enough places<br>
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room<br>
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof<br>
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset<br>
Will help us get ours as we're growing<br>
This clique means so much to this dude<br>
It could make him afraid of his music<br>
And be scared to death he could lose it<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>

<br><mark>[Interlude]</mark><br>
I'll sit here 'til I<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no<br>
I'll sit here 'til I<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
No, I move slow<br>
I want to stop time<br>
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>

Pet cheetah, cheetah<br>

You were one of those classic ones<br>
Traveling around this sun<br>
You were one of those classic ones<br>
I wish she knew you<br>
You were one of those classic ones<br>
Now everybody knows<br>
You were one of those classic ones, yeah<br>

Alright<br>
You're a legend in my own mind<br>
My middle name, my goodbye<br>

<br><mark>[Verse]</mark><br>
You were here when I wrote this<br>
But the masters and mixes<br>
Will take too long to finish to show you<br>
I'm sorry I did not visit<br>
Did not know how to take it<br>
When your eyes did not know me like I know you<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
You were one of those classic ones<br>
Travelin' around this sun<br>
You were one of those classic ones<br>
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)<br>

Now everybody knows (Wish she knew you)<br>
You were one of those classic ones, yeah<br>

I look forward to having a lunch with you again<br>

<mark>[Verse 1]</mark><br>
I'm tired of tending to this fire<br>
I've used up all I've collected<br>
I have singed my hands<br>
It's glowing, embers barely showing<br>
Proof of life in the shadows<br>
Dancing on my plans<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 2]</mark><br>
The burning is so low it's concerning<br>
'Cause they know that when it goes out<br>
It's a glorious gone<br>
It's only time before they show me<br>
Why no one ever comes back<br>
With details from beyond<br>

<br><mark>[Chorus]</mark><br>
They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
(They know)<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
(They know)<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
(They know)<br>
(They know)<br>
(They know)<br>
(They know)<br>

<br><mark>[Bridge]</mark><br>
In time, I will leave the city<br>
For now, I will stay alive<br>
In time, I will leave the city<br>
For now, I will stay alive<br>
In time, I will leave the city<br>
For now, I will stay alive<br>
In time, I will leave the city<br>
For now, I will stay alive<br>

They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>
They know that it's almost<br>
They know that it's almost over<br>

<br><mark>[Verse 3]</mark><br>
Last year I needed change of pace<br>
Couldn't take the pace of change<br>
Moving hastily<br>
But this year, though I'm far from home<br>
In Trench I'm not alone<br>
These faces facin' me<br>

<br><mark>[Outro]</mark><br>
They know<br>
They know<br>
What I mean<br>
